# Logic

[[Back to all operators]](./standard-operators.md)

In this section, you find the operators that, together with [Sets](./sets.md)
form the foundation of TLA+. It is a bit strange that we call this section
"Logic", as the whole language of TLA+ is a logic. However, the operators
of this section can be often seen in first-order logic, as opposite to the
propositional logic, see [Booleans](./booleans.md).

Note that the special form `\E y \in S: x' = y` is often used to express
non-determinism in TLA+. See [Control Flow and Non-determinism]. In this
section, we only consider the deterministic version.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Bounded universal quantifier

**Notation:** `\A x \in S: P`

**LaTeX notation:** ![forall-bounded](./img/forall-bounded.png)

**Arguments:** At least three arguments: a variable name, a set, and an
expression. As usual in TLA+, if the second argument is not a set, the result is
undefined. You can also use multiple variables and tuples, see **Advanced
syntax**. 

**Effect:** This operator evaluates to a Boolean value. We explain
semantics only for a single variable:

 - `\A x \in S: P` evaluates to `TRUE`, if for every element `e` of `S`, the
   expression `P` evaluates to `TRUE` against the binding `[x |-> e]`.
 - Conversely, `\A x \in S: P` evaluates to `FALSE`, if there exists an element
   `e` of `S` that makes the expression `P` evaluate to `FALSE` against the
   binding `[x |-> e]`.

 _Importantly, when `S = {}`, the expression `\A x \ in S: P` evaluates to
 `TRUE`, independently of what is written in `P`. Likewise, when `{x \in S: P}
 = {}`, the expression `\A x \ in S: P` evaluates to `TRUE`._
   
**Determinism:** Deterministic.

**Errors:** Pure TLA+ does not restrict the operator arguments.  TLC flags a
model checking error, if `S` is infinite.  Apalache produces a static type
error, if the type of elements of `S` is not compatible in the context of `P`
when an element of `S` is bound to `x`.

** Advanced syntax: ** Instead of a single variable `x`, you can use the tuple
syntax to unpack variables from a Cartesian product, see [Tuples](./tuples.md).
For instance, one can write `\A <<x, y>> \in S: P`. In this case, for every
element `e` of `S`, the variable `x` is bound to `e[1]` and `y` is bound to
`e[2]`. The predicate `P` is evaluated against this binding.

Moreover, instead of introducing one variable, one can quantify over several
sets. For instance, you can write: `\A x \in S, y \in T: P`. This form is
simply syntax sugar for the form with nested quantifiers: `\A x \in S: \A y
\in T: P`.

**Example in TLA+:**

```tla
  \A x \in {1, 2, 3, 4}:
    x > 0
  \* TRUE 
  \A x \in {1, 2, 3, 4}:
    x > 2
  \* FALSE
  \* check the section on tuples to understand the following syntax
  \A <<x, y>> \in { 1, 2 } \X { 3, 4 }:
    x < y
  \* TRUE
```

**Example in Python:** Python conveniently offers us a concise syntax:

```python
  S = frozenset({1, 2, 3, 4})
  all(x > 0 for x in S)         # True
  all(x > 2 for x in S)         # False
  T2 = frozenset((x, y) for x in [1, 2] for y in [3, 4])
  all(x < y for (x, y) in T2)   # True
```

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Bounded existential quantifier

**Notation:** `\E x \in S: P`

**LaTeX notation:** ![exists-bounded](./img/exists-bounded.png)

**Arguments:** At least three arguments: a variable name, a set, and an
expression. As usual in TLA+, if the second argument is not a set, the result is
undefined.You can also use multiple variables and tuples, see **Advanced
syntax**. 

**Effect:** This operator evaluates to a Boolean value. We explain
semantics only for a single variable:

 - `\E x \in S: P` evaluates to `TRUE`, if there is an element `e` of `S`
    that makes the expression `P` evaluate to `TRUE` against the binding
    `[x |-> e]`.
 - Conversely, `\E x \in S: P` evaluates to `FALSE`, if for all elements
   `e` of `S`, the expression `P` evaluate to `FALSE` against the
   binding `[x |-> e]`.

 _Importantly, when `S = {}`, the expression `\E x \ in S: P` evaluates to
 `FALSE`, independently of what is written in `P`. Likewise, when `{x \in S: P}
 = {}`, the expression `\A x \ in S: P` evaluates to `FALSE`._

 As you probably have noticed, `\E x \in S: P` is equivalent to `~(\A x \in S:
 P)`, and `\A x \in S: P` is equivalent to `~(\E x \in S: P)`. This is called
 _duality_ in logic. But take care!  If `P` contains primes inside, `\E x \in
 S: P` may work as a non-deterministic assignment. In this case, duality does
 not work anymore!  See [Control Flow and Non-determinism].
   
**Determinism:** Deterministic, unless `P` contains primes.
For the non-deterministic case, see [Control Flow and Non-determinism].

**Errors:** Pure TLA+ does not restrict the operator arguments.  TLC flags a
model checking error, if `S` is infinite.  Apalache produces a static type
error, if the type of elements of `S` is not compatible in the context of `P`
when an element of `S` is bound to `x`.

**Advanced syntax:** Instead of a single variable `x`, you can use the tuple
syntax to unpack variables from a Cartesian product, see [Tuples](./tuples.md).
For instance, one can write `\E <<x, y>> \in S: P`. In this case, for every
element `e` of `S`, the variable `x` is bound to `e[1]` and `y` is bound to
`e[2]`. The predicate `P` is evaluated against this binding.

Moreover, instead of introducing one variable, one can quantify over several
sets. For instance, you can write: `\E x \in S, y \in T: P`. This form is
simply syntax sugar for the form with nested quantifiers: `\E x \in S: \E y
\in T: P`.

**Example in TLA+:**

```tla
  \E x \in {1, 2, 3, 4}:
    x > 0
  \* TRUE 
  \E x \in {1, 2, 3, 4}:
    x > 2
  \* TRUE
  \* check the section on tuples to understand the following syntax
  \E <<x, y>> \in { 1, 2 } \X { 3, 4 }:
    x < y
  \* TRUE
```

**Example in Python:** Python conveniently offers us a concise syntax:

```python
  S = frozenset({1, 2, 3, 4})
  some(x > 0 for x in S)        # True
  some(x > 2 for x in S)        # False
  T2 = frozenset((x, y) for x in [1, 2] for y in [3, 4])
  some(x < y for (x, y) in T2)  # True
```

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Equality

_A foundational operator in TLA+_

**Notation:** `e_1 = e_2`

**LaTeX notation:** ![eq](./img/eq.png)

**Arguments:** Two arguments.

**Effect:** This operator evaluates to a Boolean value. It tests the values
of `e_1` and `e_2` for structural equality. The exact effect depends on the
values of `e_1` and `e_2`. Let `e_1` and `e_2` evaluate to the values
`v_1` and `v_2`. Then `e_1 = e_2` evaluates to:

 - If `v_1` and `v_2` are Booleans, then `e_1 = e_2` evaluates to `v_1 <=>
   v_2`.

 - If `v_1` and `v_2` are integers, then `e_1 = e_2` evaluates to `TRUE`
   if and only if `v_1` and `v_2` are exactly the same integers.

 - If `v_1` and `v_2` are strings, then `e_1 = e_2` evaluates to `TRUE`
   if and only if `v_1` and `v_2` are exactly the same strings.

 - If `v_1` and `v_2` are sets, then `e_1 = e_2` evaluates to `TRUE`
   if and only if the following expression evaluates to `TRUE`:

    ```tla
    v_1 \subseteq v_2 /\ v_2 \subseteq v_1
    ```

 - If `v_1` and `v_2` are functions, tuples, records, or sequences,
    then `e_1 = e_2` evaluates to `TRUE`
    if and only if the following expression evaluates to `TRUE`:

    ```tla
      DOMAIN v_1 = DOMAIN v_2 /\ \A x \in DOMAIN v_1: v_1[x] = v_2[x]
    ```

 - In other cases, `e_1 = e_2` evaluates to `FALSE`. TLC and Apalache report an
   error, as the values have incomparable types.
   
**Determinism:** Deterministic, unless `e_1` has the form `x'`, which can be
interpreted an assignment to the variable `x'`.  For the non-deterministic
case, see [Control Flow and Non-determinism].

**Errors:** Pure TLA+ does not restrict the operator arguments. TLC flags a
model checking error, `e_1` and `e_2` evaluate to incomparable values.
Apalache produces a static type error, if the type of `e_1` and `e_2` do not
match.

**Example in TLA+:**

```tla
  FALSE = FALSE         \* TRUE
  FALSE = TRUE          \* FALSE
  10 = 20               \* FALSE
  15 = 15               \* TRUE
  "Hello" = "world"     \* FALSE
  "Hello" = "hello"     \* FALSE
  "Bob" = "Bob"         \* TRUE
  { 1, 2 } = { 2, 3}    \* FALSE
  { 1, 2 } = { 2, 1}    \* TRUE
  { 1 } \ { 1 } = { "a" } \ { "a" } \* TRUE in pure TLA+ and TLC,
                                    \* type error in Apalache
  { { 1, 2 } } = { { 1, 2, 2, 2 } } \* TRUE
  <<1, "a">> = <<1, "a">>           \* TRUE
  <<1, "a">> = <<1, "b">>           \* FALSE
  <<1, FALSE>> = <<2>>              \* FALSE in pure TLA+ and TLC,
                                    \* type error in Apalache
  <<1, 2>> = <<1, 2, 3>>            \* FALSE in pure TLA+ and TLC,
                                    \* FALSE in Apalache, when both values
                                    \* are treated as sequences
  [ a |-> 1, b |-> 3 ] = [ a |-> 1, b |-> 3 ]           \* TRUE
  [ a |-> 1, b |-> 3 ] = [ a |-> 1 ]                    \* FALSE
  [ x \in 2..2 |-> x + x ] = [ x \in {2} |-> 2 * x ]    \* TRUE
  [ x \in 2..3 |-> x + x ] = [ x \in {2, 3} |-> 2 * x ] \* FALSE
```

**Example in Python:** The standard data structures also implement
    structural equality in Python, though we have to be careful to
    use `==` instead of `=`:

```python
  False == False
  False == True
  10 == 20
  15 == 15
  "Hello" == "world"
  "Hello" == "hello"
  "Bob" == "Bob"
  frozenset({ 1, 2 }) == frozenset({ 2, 3 })
  frozenset({ 1, 2 }) == frozenset({ 2, 1 })
  frozenset({ 1 }) - frozenset({ 1 }) == frozenset({ "a" }) - frozenset({ "a" })
  frozenset({ frozenset({ 1, 2 }) }) == frozenset({ frozenset({ 1, 2, 2, 2 }) })
  (1, "a") == (1, "a")
  (1, "a") == (1, "b")
  (1, False) == (2, )
  (1, 2) == (1, 2, 3)
  { "a": 1, "b": 3 } == { "a": 1, "b": 3 }
  { "a": 1, "b": 3 } == { "a": 1 }
  { x: (x + x) for x in { 2 } } == { x: (x * x) for x in { 2 } }
  { x: (x + x) for x in { 2, 3 } } == { x: 2 * x for x in { 2, 3 } } 
```

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Inequality

**Notation:** `e_1 /= e_2` or `e_1 # e_2`

**LaTeX notation:** ![ne](./img/ne.png)

**Arguments:** Two arguments.

**Effect:** This operator is syntax sugar for `~(e_1 = e_2)`. Full stop.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Bounded Choice

_This operator causes a lot of confusion. Read carefully!_

**Notation:** `CHOOSE x \in S: P`

**LaTeX notation:** ![choose-bounded](./img/choose-bounded.png)

**Arguments:** Three arguments: a variable name, a set, and an
expression.

**Effect:** This operator is a magical device by the definition, no kidding. It
is a blackbox algorithm that _somehow_ picks one element `e` of `S` that
satisfies the expression `P` against the binding `[x |-> e]` and returns this
element `e`.

Did we say "an algorithm"? Yes! `CHOOSE x \in S: P` is deterministic.  If you
give it two equal sets and two equivalent predicates, it will give you the
same value. More formally, the only known property of `CHOOSE` is as follows:

```tla
  {x \in S: P} = {y \in T: Q} =>
      (CHOOSE x \in S: P) = (CHOOSE y \in T: Q)
```

Importantly, when `{x \in S: P} = {}`, the expression `CHOOSE x \ in S: P`
    evaluates to an undefined value.

How does it work? We don't know. Nobody knows. Maybe it returns the first
element of the set? Well, sets are not ordered, so there is no first element.

Why shall you use it? Actually, you should not. Unless you have no other
choice :bowtie:

There are two common use cases, where the use of `CHOOSE` is well justified.

 - _Use case 1:_ Retrieving the only element of a singleton set. If you know
    that `Cardinality({x \in S: P}) = 1`, then `CHOOSE x \in S: P` returns
    the only element of `{x \in S: P}`. No magic.
    For instance, see: [Min and Max in FiniteSetsExt].

 - _Use case 2:_ Enumerating set elements in a fixed but unknown order.
    For instance, see: [ReduceSet in FiniteSetsExt].

In other cases, we believe that `CHOOSE` is bound to do [Program synthesis].
So TLC does some form of synthesis by brute force when it has to evaluate
`CHOOSE`.
   
**Determinism:** Deterministic. Very much deterministic. Don't try to model
non-determinism with `CHOOSE`. For non-determinism, see:
[Control Flow and Non-determinism].

Apalache picks a set element that satisfies the predicate `P`, but it does not
guarantee the repeatability property of CHOOSE. It does not guarantee
non-determinism either. Interestingly, this behavior does not really make a
difference for the use cases 1 and 2. If you believe that this causes a problem
in your specification, [open an issue...]

**Errors:** Pure TLA+ does not restrict the operator arguments.  TLC flags a
model checking error, if `S` is infinite.  Apalache produces a static type
error, if the type of elements of `S` is not compatible in the context of `P`
when an element of `S` is bound to `x`.

**Example in TLA+:**

```tla
  CHOOSE x \in 1..3: x >= 3
  \* 3
  CHOOSE x \in 1..3:
    \A y \in 1..3: y >= x
  \* 1, the minimum
  CHOOSE f \in [ 1..10 -> BOOLEAN ]:
    \E x, y \in DOMAIN f:
      f[x] /\ ~f[y]
  \* some Boolean function from 1..10 that covers FALSE and TRUE
```

**Example in Python:** Python does not have anything similar to `CHOOSE`.
The closest possible solution is to sort the filtered set by the string values
and pick the first one (or the last one). So we have introduced a particular
way of implementing CHOOSE, see [choose.py](./examples/choose.py):

```python
# A fixed implementation of CHOOSE x \in S: TRUE
# that sorts the set by the string representation and picks the head 
def choose(s):
    lst = sorted([(str(e), e) for e in s], key=(lambda pair: pair[0]))
    (_, e) = lst[0]
    return e


if __name__ == "__main__":
    s = frozenset({ 1, 2, 3}) 
    print("CHOOSE {} = {}".format(s, choose(s)))
    s2 = frozenset({ frozenset({1}), frozenset({2}), frozenset({3})})
    print("CHOOSE {} = {}".format(s2, choose(s2)))
```

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Unbounded universal quantifier

**Notation:** `\A x: P`

**LaTeX notation:** ![forall](./img/forall.png)

**Arguments:** At least two arguments: a variable name and an
expression. 

**Effect:** This operator evaluates to a Boolean value. It evaluates to `TRUE`,
when every element in the logical universe makes the expression `P` evaluate to
`TRUE` against the binding `[x |-> e]`. More precisely, we have to consider
only the elements that produced a defined result when evaluating `P`.

Neither TLC, nor Apalache support this operator. It is impossible to give
operational semantics for this operator, unless we explicitly introduce the
universe. It requires a first-order logic solver. This operator may be useful
when writing proofs with [TLAPS].

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Unbounded existential quantifier

**Notation:** `\E x: P`

**LaTeX notation:** ![exists](./img/exists.png)

**Arguments:** At least two arguments: a variable name and an
expression. 

**Effect:** This operator evaluates to a Boolean value. It evaluates to `TRUE`,
when at least one element in the logical universe makes the expression `P`
evaluate to `TRUE` against the binding `[x |-> e]`. More precisely, we have to
consider only the elements that produced a defined result when evaluating `P`.

Neither TLC, nor Apalache support this operator. It is impossible to give
operational semantics for this operator, unless we explicitly introduce the
universe. It requires a first-order logic solver. This operator may be useful
when writing proofs with [TLAPS].

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Unbounded CHOOSE

**Notation:** `CHOOSE x: P`

**LaTeX notation:** CHOOSE x: P

**Arguments:** At least two arguments: a variable name and an
expression. 

**Effect:** This operator evaluates to some value `v` in the logical universe
that evaluates `P` to `TRUE` against the binding `[x |-> v]`.

Neither TLC, nor Apalache support this operator. It is impossible to give
operational semantics for this operator, unless we explicitly introduce the
universe and introduce a fixed rule for enumerating its elements.

Congratulations! You have reached the bottom of this page. If you like to learn
