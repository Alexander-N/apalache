/**
  * <p>Arithmetic operators in TLA+ (as defined in Naturals, Integers, and Reals).
  * Note that modules inherit operator definitions. In other words,
  * Reals inherits definitions of + and - from Integers, which inherit definitions from Naturals.
  * Thus, though these operators are semantically different, these operators are introduced using
  * the same definition in TLA+ tools. We also instantiate each operator only once.</p>
  *
  * <p>Alternatively, we could have introduced multiple copies of each operator (for Naturals, Integers, and Reals)
  * and use the most general operator, e.g., using addition on reals, when a module extends Reals.
  * However, this would not give us precise type information when one mixes integer and real arithmetic.
  * Consequently, we use just one copy per operator and hope that type analysis would be able to infer tighter types.</p>
