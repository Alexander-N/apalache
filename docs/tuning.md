Parameters for fine tuning
==========================

The parameters for fine tuning can be passed to the checker in a properties file.
Its name is given with the command-line option ``--tuning=my.properties.`` 

  1. __Guided search__: ``search.transitionFilter=<sequence>``. Restrict the choice of symbolic
  transitions at every step with a regular expression. For instance, ``search.filter=0,5,2|3``
  requres to start with the 0th transition, continue with the 5th transition,
  then execute either the 2nd or the 3rd transition and after that execute
  arbitrary transitions until the ``length.`` Note that there is no direct correspondence
  between the transition numbers and the actions in the TLA+ spec. Check the 
  transition numbers in ``detailed.log``.
  
  1. __Invariant checking at certain steps__: ``search.invariantFilter=regex``.
  Check the invariant only at the steps that satisfy the regular expression.
  For instance, ``search.invariantFilter=10|15|20`` tells the model checker to
  check the invariant only *after* exactly 10, 15, or 20 step were made. Step 0 corresponds
  to the initialization with ``Init``, step 1 is the first step with ``Next``, etc.
  This option is useful for checking consensus algorithms, where the decision
  cannot be revoked. So instead of checking the invariant after each step, we can
  do that after the algorithm has made a good number of steps. 
    
  1. __Randomized search__: ``search.randomDfs=(false|true)``. When the symbolic transitions
  are enumerated in the depth-first order, that is, ``search=dfs``, choose the next transition
  randomly.
